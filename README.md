# verkle-test-vectors
It contains test vectors for Verkle Trees separated in two categories:
- Cryptography
- Tree (state) 

Probably many of these tests will eventually leak into other formal spec test repositories, but for now, they are here.

The current plan of test to cover can be found in [this document](https://hackmd.io/@jsign/verkle-test-vectors).
